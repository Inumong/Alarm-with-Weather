1. About
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Alarm is a small shell script that can aid you in alerting you of things at
	specified times. It does this by displaying a message in X (using one of
	the variety of X message displaying tools) at the time of the alert.

	It supports a very flexible time input format (i.e. 'tomorrow', '5 may
	2005', 'tomorrow 20:00'), one-time alerts and repeated alerts.


1.1. Installation and setup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2. Requirements
-----------------

	Alert requires the following to be installed:
		
		* X11
		
	And at least ONE OF THE FOLLOWING programs to be installed:

		   * xmessage
		OR * dialog in combination with a terminal emulator
		OR * gdialog

1.3. Installation
-----------------

	1. Copy the 'alarm' script to a directory that is present in the path.
	2. Add the following line to the .xinitrc file in your home directory:
		
		alarm --daemon&
	
2. Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Alarm can run in two modes. The first is the daemon mode in which it will
	notify you of events when they occur and the other is the edit mode through
	which you can add, change, delete and list events. Alarm in daemon mode
	should be run under X.
